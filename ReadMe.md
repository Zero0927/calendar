##Introduction
This is a calendar to let user set reminder based on daily, weekly, monthly or yearly with custom interval time.


## Basic features

Use rrule library for working with recurrence rules for calendar dates.

rrule.js supports recurrence rules as defined in the [iCalendar
RFC](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt), with a few important
[differences](#differences-from-icalendar-rfc). It is a partial port of the
`rrule` module from the excellent
[python-dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil/) library. On top of
that, it supports parsing and serialization of recurrence rules from and
to natural language.
